# Markov modelling in R

This page is dedicated to learning how to build a Markov model in R, starting from using basic R code to build a simple Markov chain, to presenting statistical uncertainty in R Shiny. To do so, a simple approach is being followed;

- [x] Do exercise 2.5 from [Decision Modelling in Health Economic Evaluation](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation) (Briggs et al.) in R. This is optional for those comfortable with Excel.
- [x] Get started with R using [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html/)
  - use the [Base R](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf) cheatsheet as a nice reference.
- [X] Reproduce exercise 2.5 from Briggs et al. in R.
- [] Learn intermediate and advanced R topics from the list below (we'll find out which ones will prove to be essential)
  - [Tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for additional data science tools. Learning either through the book (R for Data Science)[https://r4ds.had.co.nz] or the Swirl course [Getting and Cleaning Data](http://swirlstats.com/scn/getclean.html).
  - [Heemod package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/heemod) for tools specific to health economic outcomes research.
  - [Statistical Programming and Applications](https://acaimo.github.io/teaching/MAIN/Stat_Prog_App.html) module from the University of Dublin.
  - [Topics in Applied Statistics](https://acaimo.github.io/teaching/MAIN/Topics_App_Stats.html) module from the University of Dublin.

Below here is a simple tutorial for GitHub pages that has nothing to do with the R study club...

## Intro 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PeterElroy/R-Study-Club/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PeterElroy/R-Study-Club/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
