# Cost-effectiveness analysis in R

This page is dedicated to learning how to perform a cost-effectiveness data-analysis in R with a focus on the field of Health Economics and Outcomes Research. It does not consider R to be the only valid development platform for data science, but as good a place to start as any. The learning materials used are all freely available, thanks to all the educators and developers who shared them with everyone.


he plan is based purely on freely available materials so that anyone can access them, with a thank you to all the educators and developers who made these materials available. We follow the excercise of building a simple Markov chain model laid out in exercise 2.5 of Decision Modelling in Health Economic Evaluation using freely available learning starting from using basic R code to build a simple Markov chain, to presenting statistical uncertainty in R Shiny. We do so by reproducing a simple exercise at increasing levels of difficulty;

1. A working knowledge is assumed that allows you to understand what's going on in the solution of exercise 2.5 from [Decision Modelling in Health Economic Evaluation](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation) (Briggs et al.). This Excel file can be viewed in the freely available software package [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
2. Get started with R using [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html/) and choose the 'R programming' course when you see it. You can use the [Base R](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf) cheatsheet as a nice reference.
3. To put what you learned to the test, try to reproduce exercise 2.5 from Briggs et al. in R. You will likely need to learn about logical loops in R which is not covered in the 'R Programming' course in Swirl. A tutorial focussed on this is available on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-on-loops-in-r).
4. Learn intermediate and advanced R topics from the list below (we'll find out which ones will prove to be essential as we go along)
  - [Tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for additional data science tools. Learning either through the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) or the Swirl course [Getting and Cleaning Data](http://swirlstats.com/scn/getclean.html).
  - [Heemod package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/heemod) for tools specific to health economic outcomes research.
  - [Statistical Programming and Applications](https://acaimo.github.io/teaching/MAIN/Stat_Prog_App.html) module from the University of Dublin.
  - [Topics in Applied Statistics](https://acaimo.github.io/teaching/MAIN/Topics_App_Stats.html) module from the University of Dublin.
 5. Learn R shiny to create clean web interface to present your models with. There is an official course over on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home/).
 6. Reproduce the Briggs et al. exercise in R Shiny.
 7. Develop your own cool R Shiny HEOR widget.
 

Below here is a simple tutorial for GitHub pages that has nothing to do with the R study club...

## Intro 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PeterElroy/R-Study-Club/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PeterElroy/R-Study-Club/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
